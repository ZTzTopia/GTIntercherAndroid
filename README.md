## 💻 Requirements
The following dependencies are required to build the library from source.
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).

For AIDE users: I've tried to fix all the errors in AIDE, but I can't get a satisfactory result. Because AIDE does not support AndroidX and lacks many features. Yes, even though I fixed AndroidX but still can't install the apk.
Android is very slow when deleting and moving files it's very frustrating for me.

## 🔨 Building
1. Build the source code.
2. Install the application.
3. Profit.

**If you can't make it you can download the finished application on the release page.**
